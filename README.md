### Vitest Testing Framework Unit Testing project

This practice project is in addition to Codecademyâ€™s Jest and RTL testing course. The console uses Create React App and Jest.

I have been using only Vite for my projects. After practicing locally, I started using the Vitest testing framework, which is a faster, modern framework made for testing Vite-created applications.

 Testing:

- Rendering
- Simulating user interactions
- Testing and mocking API requests
- Testing functions
- Test form input, submit



I learned a lot from these videos:

I used AI to give me ideas for test cases, help me write more efficient tests, and help me with refactoring.
